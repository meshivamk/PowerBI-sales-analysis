## ⚙️ Data Preparation Process

### **1. Data Loading**
- Imported all yearly sales files: `Sales2017.csv`, `Sales2018.csv`, `Sales2019.csv`, `Sales2020.csv`.
- Set the first row as headers and standardized data types.
- Removed redundant columns and combined yearly files into one consolidated **Sales** table.

### **2. Data Transformation**
- Cleaned customer, reseller, and product data:
  - Removed nulls and unnecessary columns (e.g., Postal).
  - Split combined columns (City/State/Country) using delimiters.
- Adjusted column types (Date, Numeric, Text).

### **3. Data Modelling**
- **Fact Table:** `Sales`
- **Dimension Tables:** `Customer`, `Product`, `Sales Territory`, `Reseller`, `Sales Order`
- Established **1-to-Many** relationships between dimensions and the Sales fact table.
- Added an additional **Date Table** for time intelligence.
